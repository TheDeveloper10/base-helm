# base-helm
The goal is to create a versatile, all-in-one Helm chart that can be used universally to deploy simple services with minimal effort, making it adaptable for any scenario.
It is based on the default helm chart.

### TODOs
- Add network policy
- Add deployment of custom resources
- Add role/clusterrole, rolebinding and clusterrolebinding.
